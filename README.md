## About

The stack we use are: React (custom hooks, useContext, useState, useEffect, useRef), Firebase (Firestore/auth) & Tailwind CSS.

we will build an Instagram clone! This React project has multiple pages: login, sign up, dashboard (to view/like/comment on photos), and user profiles.

The sign-in page will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I built this application using React, JavaScript, Firebase and for styling I used Tailwind CSS.
